Note:
don't call node.js in html file, but use node.js to load the HTML!! (not 100% sure)

Things to do: <br>
- Try example of socket.io, and understand how it works. (link above about node.js might help!) <br>
- Try example of Monaco, and understand how it works.

Next Step: <br>
- integrate monaco and socket.io, to create a webpage that has both functionality in it.
